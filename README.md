This project uses the most popular classification techniques to predict the outcomes after extensively working on EDA treating missing values and imbalanced data. This project has two parts. 

Part 1-Healthcare: Predicting the condition of the patient depending on the received test results on biomechanics features of the patients according to their current conditions. 

Part 2-Banking, Marketing: Built an predictive model using KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression to perform focused marketing by predicting the potential customers who will convert using the historical database. Implemented targeted marketing strategies by predicting customer conversion likelihood.
