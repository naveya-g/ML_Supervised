# ML_Supervised

This project leverages popular classification techniques to predict outcomes after conducting extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling missing values, and addressing imbalanced data. It is divided into two parts:

Part 1 - Healthcare: A model was developed to predict patient conditions based on test results and biomechanics features. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) was used, achieving an accuracy of 84%.

Part 2 - Banking and Marketing: A predictive model was built using KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression to identify potential customers likely to convert, enabling focused marketing strategies. Through thorough data processing and model optimization, the model achieved a 96% accuracy in predicting customer conversion.
